Hashtopolis is a multi-platform client-server tool for distributing hashcat tasks to multiple computers. The main goals for Hashtopolis's development are portability, robustness, multi-user support, and multiple groups management.
The application has two parts:

- **Agent** Multiple clients (C#, Python), easily customizable to suit any need.
- **Server** several PHP/CSS files operating on two endpoints: an Admin GUI and an Agent Connection Point

Aiming for high usability even on restricted networks, Hashtopolis communicates over HTTP(S) using a human-readable, hashing-specific dialect of JSON.

The server part runs on PHP using MySQL as the database back end. It is vital that your MySQL server is configured with performance in mind. Queries can be very expensive and proper configuration makes the difference between a few milliseconds of waiting and disastrous multi-second lags. The database schema heavily profits from indexing. Therefore, if you see a hint about pre-sorting your hashlist, please do so.

The web admin interface is the single point of access for all client agents. New agent deployments require a one-time password generated in the New Agent tab. This reduces the risk of leaking hashes or files to rogue or fake agents.

There are parts of the documentation and wiki which are not up-to-date. If you see anything wrong or have questions on understanding descriptions, feel free to contact us on Twitter (@s3inlc, @winxp5421) or join our Discord server (https://discord.gg/S2NTxbz)

To report a bug, please create an issue and try to describe the problem as accurately as possible. This helps us to identify the bug and see if it is reproducible.

In an effort to make the Hashtopussy project conform to a more politically neutral name it was rebranded to "Hashtopolis" in March 2018.

## Contribution Guidelines

We are open to all kinds of contributions. If it's a bug fix or a new feature, feel free to create a pull request. Please consider some points:

* Just include one feature or one bugfix in one pull request. In case you have two new features please also create two pull requests.
* Try to stick with the code style used (especially in the PHP parts). IntelliJ/PHPStorm users can get a code style XML [here](https://gist.github.com/s3inlc/226ed78b05eb6dc8f60f18d6fd310d74).

The pull request will then be reviewed by at least one member and merged after approval. Don't be discouraged just because the first review is not approved, often these are just small changes.
